# Arkanoid Game

Arkanoid is a classic brick-breaking game where the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks. This web-based implementation of Arkanoid is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Ball and Paddle Movement**: The ball moves around the screen, bouncing off walls and the paddle.
- **Brick Destruction**: Bricks are arranged in a grid, and when the ball collides with a brick, it destroys the brick.
- **Paddle Control**: The player can move the paddle left and right to bounce the ball and prevent it from falling.
- **Game Over Detection**: If the ball falls below the paddle, the game ends, and the player can restart.
- **Responsive Design**: The game layout adjusts to different screen sizes for optimal gameplay experience.
